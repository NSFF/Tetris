TO INSTALL:
	1. extract zip file
	2. run your terminal and go to the right directory where you extracted the file. 
	(you can do this by typing: cd your_directory in the terminal)

	3. type: make all (this will compile all the files)

TO RUN:
	1. follow the TO INSTALL instructions so the files are compiled
	2. type ./game to run the program in the terminal

TO REMOVE:
	if you just want to remove all object files and the executable file:
		type: make remove (this will remove all .o files and the executable file)
		could be handy if the compiling failed
	if you want to uninstall the program, just delete the whole folder
